### Payslip coding challenge




## Design Decisions and assumptions
I used Materialize design framework, it's nice and clean. Screens are responsive.
I haven't spent a lot of time trying to match the colours exactly as this would be specified normally, I have used approximate HTML colour names.
I haven't spent a lot of time trying to match the fonts as this would be specified normally, I have used a standard Materialize font.
I haven't been able to get the interface with api.js working properly, I have checked the screens directly in the browser.
